# DCNN-qR1V: Eye Analysis for Influence Detection

## Overview
DCNN-qR1V is an advanced AI-driven tool designed to leverage Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) and TensorFlow to analyze images of the eyes and determine whether an individual is under the influence. By combining cutting-edge machine learning techniques with sophisticated image processing, DCNN-qR1V aims to provide a non-invasive, accurate, and efficient method for influence detection, offering a valuable resource for law enforcement, medical professionals, and safety officers.

## Features
- **High Precision Analysis**: Utilizes state-of-the-art DCNN models for detailed image analysis.
- **TensorFlow Integration**: Leverages TensorFlow for robust machine learning operations and model training.
- **Non-invasive Testing**: Offers a safe and comfortable testing experience without the need for blood tests.
- **Rapid Results**: Delivers fast and reliable assessments, facilitating timely decision-making.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for ease of use in various operational contexts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV for image processing
- NumPy for numerical operations

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DCNN-qR1V.git
```
### How It Works
DCNN-qR1V processes input images through a series of convolutional layers designed to detect and analyze specific features within the eye that are indicative of substance influence. The model evaluates patterns such as pupil dilation, eye redness, and other micro-expressions that are difficult to discern through manual inspection.
